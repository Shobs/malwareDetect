A Simple Malware detection website
====================

This app is the final project for server side programming class CS 174.

The idea is to create a web-based Antivirus application that allows the users to upload a file (of any type) to check if it contains malicious content. That is, if it is a Malware or not.

Features:

Web pages:

    - Ensures a secure Session mechanism.
    - Allows the user to submit a putative infected file and shows if it is infected or not.
    - Lets authenticate an Admin and allows him/her to submit a Malware file, plus the name of the uploaded Malware.
    - When an Admin adds the name of a malware during the uploading of a Malware file, it ensures that the string contains only English letters (capitalized or not) and digits. Any other character, or an empty string, must be avoided. 

 
Web Application:

    - Reads the file in input, per bytes, and, if is Malware, stores the sequence of bytes, say, the first 20 bytes (signature) of the file, in a database (Note: only an Admin can upload a Malware file)
    - Reads the file in input, per bytes, and, if it is a putative infected file, searches within the file for one of the strings stored in the database (Note: a normal user will always upload putative infected files)

 
MySQL database:

    - Stores the information regarding the infected files in input, such as name of the malware (not the name of the file) and the sequence of bytes
    - Stores the information related to the Admin with username and password, in the most secure way of your knowledge.


I additionally implemented a routing system, helper classes and an installation script.

More information about the flow of the application can be found in config.php



The basic mvc setup was inspired from: http://requiremind.com/a-most-simple-php-mvc-beginners-tutorial/
